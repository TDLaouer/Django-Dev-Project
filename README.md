# A personal blog site

Web developpement by the django web framework


## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6.7
- Pip 18.1


You need to install django to run the server, to do so, follow the instructions from this link (if using linux, which I recommend): https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-django-on-ubuntu-18-04/

The guide suggests you use a virtual environement, I very highly recommend it to have a small controlled dev environnement that does not conflict with other system functionalities.

## The project

In the project you can find the core tools located in the djangoproj folder, and all the site functionalities, including the views and the templates, are found in the accounts and home folders.
